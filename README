Flot plugin to display angled X-axis tick labels.
https://github.com/markrcote/flot-tickrotor

Requires flot 0.7 or higher and a browser supporting <canvas>.

To activate, just set xaxis.rotateTicks to an angle in degrees.  Labels are
rotated clockwise, so if you want the labels to angle up and to the right
(/) you need to provide an angle > 90.  The text will be flipped so that it
is still right-side-up.

Angles greater than or equal to 180 are ignored.

If the standard flot xaxis.font settings object is present, that is 
used for formatting the tick labels.
Eg:
xaxis {
  font: {
  	size: 12, /* Expressed in pixels */
  	style: "italic",
  	weight: "bold",
  	family: "sans-serif",
  	variant: "small-caps",
  	color: "#545454"
  }
}

If set, xaxis.rotateTicksFont is used for the ticks font.  This follows the 
canvas API font style specification format.

Otherwise, the CSS font property for the tickLabel class is used.  If none
are set, the default is 'smaller sans-serif'.

The graph is resized so that all labels can be displayed properly.
- NOTE: currently this only works with label angle > 90 degrees.

If you are using this with flot-axislabels, include flot-tickrotor *before*
flot-axislabels, since the former completely redefines the X-axis
labelHeight, and the latter only modifies it.

TODO
----

- Fix plot resizing with long labels when angle < 90 degrees.  It seems to
  require a y2axis at the moment and fails if one isn't defined.
